# Project Instructions:
**1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
* Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
* Perform basic data exploration:
* Check dataset info, missing values, and statistical summaries

**2. Data Preprocessing**
* Fix column formats
* Handle Outliers and Missing Values
* Add Binary Features

**3. Filter and Clean Data**
* Filter the dataset to include only houses priced below $3 million
* Verify the dataset size after filtering

**4. EDA**
* Analyze pirce distribution
* Examine Relationships Between Features and Price

**5. Feature Engineering**
* Create New Features
* Normalize Key Features
* Neighborhood Clustering

**6. Prepare Data for Modeling**
* Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
* Define the target variable (price) and predictors based on EDA and feature engineering

**7. Model Training and Evaluation**
* Baseline Model - Linear Regression
* Advanced Model like  Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models

**8. Hyperparameter Tuning**
* Optimize the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV
* Identify the best hyperparameters and evaluate the tuned model on the test set.
